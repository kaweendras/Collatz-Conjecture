## Introduction

The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, is a mathematical sequence defined as follows:

- Start with any positive integer.
- If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- Repeat the process until the number reaches 1.

This website allows you to input a positive integer and visualize the Collatz Conjecture sequence generated for that number.

## Features

- Calculate and display Collatz Conjecture sequences.
- Interactive user interface for exploring the sequence.
